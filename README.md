In this browser-based 3D game, your goal is to safely deliver a flock of duckies to their home. Use your keyboard to navigate through dangerous terrain. May each lucky ducky survive!

We utilized the Three.js library which uses WebGL to render 3D computer graphics and animations. HTML5 allows us to display our game on a canvas element in the browser and we were able to manipulate the user interface with the DOM API and CSS3. Our team used object oriented programming to handle placement and interactions of 3D models within the game. This was a fun project which allowed us to utilize our skills in a creative way. We hope you enjoy it!

Instructions: Use your keyboard's arrow keys to navigate through the maze. You win when you've delivered your duckies to their goal! Press A for first-person view or S for bird's-eye view. Press D to shoot fireballs and eliminate obstacles.
